Rerun is an Apache 2 or later licensed utility.  Many files distributed in
the rerun distribution are generated by autoconf which are GPL v3 or later.
These GPL files are a dependency on the build system and are independent
works.

Since this is a github project and an autoconf project, the
README file is not used, README.md is the file to READ!

When you checkout the file, run "setup.sh" which gets autoconf initialized.
Then follow the instructions in INSTALL.  Real standard stuff...
